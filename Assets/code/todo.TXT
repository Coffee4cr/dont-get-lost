Ongoing
- Create unique sprites for everything
- More foliage (small plants/flowers)

Tasks
- Item flow recording should be done on link points?
- Fix farming spots so that they display properly
- Implement teleport-to-player
- Work out the exact swing-path of melee weapons in order to interpolate and detect collisions
- Spread biome.generate across multiple frames
- Optimize chase paths (i.e don't double back if thats what the player did)
- Make characters fall if they are following a chase path
- Figure out how to stop enemies bunching up when chasing
- Tutorial (maybe just some achivements to follow in the spawn biome?)
- Awarenes meter for enemies?

- Networking bugs for settlers
	- Items creation by settlers isn't networked (remote procedure call? - no, it actually
	  makes sense to stick with the current framework, so stuff like crop progress
	  gets saved etc.)
	- Control over character arms/legs is fighting between client+server - this is
	  actually an artifact of the character position lerping. Putting a ceiling on
	  how fast the arms are allowed to move has lessened this problem.
	- When authority over settlers change, they jump back to nearest target
	  (settlers should probably reset to nearest settler_path_element + do
	   pathing from there)
    - Networked floats aren't lerping properly (see growth of wheat for example)
	- Network tasking system (create networked children of settler_interactables, with
	  a reference to the network id of the settler assigned?)
