Ongoing
- Create unique sprites for everything
- More foliage? (small plants/flowers)

TODO
- Item flow recording should be done on link points?
- Work out the exact swing-path of melee weapons in order to interpolate and detect collisions
- Optimize chase paths 
	don't double back if thats what the player did
	Make characters fall if they are following a chase path
	Figure out how to stop enemies bunching up when chasing
- Awarenes meter for enemies?
- Fishing
- Point-to-point connection building (like string or rope)
- Production counter?
- Filter-splitter
- Leave item in inventory when equipping with Q?

- Networking bugs(?) for settlers
	- Items creation by settlers isn't networked (remote procedure call? - no, it actually
	  makes sense to stick with the current framework, so stuff like crop progress
	  gets saved etc.)
	- Control over character arms/legs is fighting between client+server - this is
	  actually an artifact of the character position lerping. Putting a ceiling on
	  how fast the arms are allowed to move has lessened this problem.
