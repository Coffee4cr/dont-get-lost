Ongoing
- Create unique sprites for everything
- More foliage? (small plants/flowers)

TODO
- Item flow recording should be done on link points?
- Work out the exact swing-path of melee weapons in order to interpolate and detect collisions
- Spread biome.generate across multiple frames
- Optimize chase paths 
	don't double back if thats what the player did
	Make characters fall if they are following a chase path
	Figure out how to stop enemies bunching up when chasing
- Tutorial (maybe just some achivements to follow in the spawn biome?)
- Awarenes meter for enemies?
- Some sort of more-continuous version of a path (maybe generalize settler_path_link
  to allow some sort of extended_path_link that links when overlapped...)
- Fishing
- Multiple items per strike for overpowered tools
- Ready-to-assign method for settler interactlabes? (e.g shops with no materials return false)
- Point-to-point connection building (like string or rope)
- Item buffers (store an amount of an item and only output if connected input is free)
- Re-implement remote item use

- Networking bugs for settlers
	- Items creation by settlers isn't networked (remote procedure call? - no, it actually
	  makes sense to stick with the current framework, so stuff like crop progress
	  gets saved etc.)
	- Control over character arms/legs is fighting between client+server - this is
	  actually an artifact of the character position lerping. Putting a ceiling on
	  how fast the arms are allowed to move has lessened this problem.
    - Networked floats aren't lerping properly (see growth of wheat for example)
