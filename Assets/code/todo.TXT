Ongoing
- Create unique sprites for everything
- More foliage? (small plants/flowers)

TODO
- Item flow recording should be done on link points?
- Work out the exact swing-path of melee weapons in order to interpolate and detect collisions
- Optimize chase paths 
	don't double back if thats what the player did
	Make characters fall if they are following a chase path
	Figure out how to stop enemies bunching up when chasing
- Point-to-point connection building (like string or rope)
- Production counter?
- Filter-splitter
- Remove the off-by-one thing happenng with player.slot_equipped
- Make settler_interactable return a task object, this will make it
  easier to make settler_interactables work for multiple settlers (see
  the way that lootboxes work at the moment)

- Networking bugs(?) for settlers
	- Control over character arms/legs is fighting between client+server - this is
	  actually an artifact of the character position lerping. Putting a ceiling on
	  how fast the arms are allowed to move has lessened this problem.
