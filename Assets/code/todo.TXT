Ongoing
- Create unique sprites for everything
- More foliage? (small plants/flowers)

TODO
- Item flow recording/reproducing if out of range?
- Work out the exact swing-path of melee weapons in order to interpolate and detect collisions
- Optimize chase paths
	don't double back if thats what the player did
	Make characters fall if they are following a chase path
	Figure out how to stop enemies bunching up when chasing
- Point-to-point connection building (e.g ropes for a rope bridge)
- Remove the off-by-one thing happenng with player.slot_equipped (not a bug, just
  at some points in the code is indexed from 0 and others from 1, which is mildly annoying).
- Pickup/dropoff points for settlers to move items around?
- Make certain types of animal farms convert materials into products (e.g straw into milk via cows)
- Fuel value should be an attachable component, rather than a value for every item
- Make it more obvious which side of a ladder is the front
- Make time command work from non-auth clients
- PvP hit markers
- Player health desyncs on different clients on death (sometimes?) - was this down to the default-value
  bug recently fixed?
- Update all the on_ methods in the networked class to be listeners that can be +='d (big job, but would
  allow the simplification of the code in a lot of places) - does the new callbacks structure of 
  IExtendsNetworked cover these use cases?
- Brewing!
- Just make foundary stuff/see if a use for the metal becomes apparent
  Make settlers use tools (which wear out) for certain tasks - should constitue a use for metals etc.
- town_path_element.path spread load across multiple frames.
- Make autocrafters work with buffer chests
- Settlers heads move over to their shoulder with time
- Fishing dock not doing anything on non-auth clients? (also doesn't check for water)
- Guard spots not doing anything on non-auth clients?
- Player skin color
- Remove gender entirely (I think there is still an associated variable)
- Add cowering spots to various things (beds)
- Priority splitter (just a hole in a gutter?)
  Maybe a 50% splitter that is just a hole in a plank gutter (rather than the swinging arm thing).
- Ensure ankles stay attached to legs
