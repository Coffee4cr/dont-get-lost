Ongoing
- Create unique sprites for everything
- More foliage? (small plants/flowers)

TODO
- Item flow recording/reproducing if out of range?
- Work out the exact swing-path of melee weapons in order to interpolate and detect collisions
- Optimize chase paths
	don't double back if thats what the player did
	Make characters fall if they are following a chase path
	Figure out how to stop enemies bunching up when chasing
- Point-to-point connection building (e.g ropes for a rope bridge)
- Maybe a 50% splitter that is just a hole in a plank gutter (rather than the swinging arm thing).
- Remove the off-by-one thing happenng with player.slot_equipped (not a bug, just
  at some points in the code is indexed from 0 and others from 1, which is mildly annoying).
- Make settler_interactable return a task object, this will make it
  easier to make settler_interactables work for multiple settlers (see
  the way that lootboxes work at the moment)
- Pickup/dropoff points for settlers to move items around?
- Remove/improve player food mechanic
- Make certain types of animal farms convert materials into products (e.g straw into milk via cows)
- Mining spots sometimes forget what is in range - perhaps something to do
  with loading/unloading on different clients?
- Fuel value should be an attachable component, rather than a value for every item
- Make it more obvious which side of a ladder is the front
- Make time command work from non-auth clients
- PvP hit markers
- Player health desyncs on different clients on death (sometimes?)
- Update all the on_ methods in the networked class to be listeners that can be +='d (big job, but would
  allow the simplification of the code in a lot of places)

- Networking bugs(?) for settlers
	- Control over character arms/legs is fighting between client+server - this is
	  actually an artifact of the character position lerping. Putting a ceiling on
	  how fast the arms are allowed to move has lessened this problem.
	- Settlers sleep standing up on non-auth clients
	- Settlers always show "no assigment" when inspected on non-auth clients
	- Fishing dock not doing anything on non-auth clients (also doesn't check for water)
	- Guard spots not doing anything on non-auth clients
