- Item flow recording should be done on link points?
- Figure out why items slide into one another on gutters
- Get rid of settlers/all that goes with that (fixtures etc...)?
- Create unique sprites for everything (ongoing)
- Fix farming spots so that they display properly
- Implement teleport-to-player
- Remove biome-based character spawning (revert to local spawners only)
- Work out the exact swing-path of melee weapons in order to interpolate and detect collisions
